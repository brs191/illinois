Week 1

CIE RGB Color Space
CIE XYZ Color Space
xyY Color Space
CIE xy Chromocity Diagram
sRGB Color Space
Gamma Correction

Quiz 1:
1. Chromicity Diagram
Which of the following statements about the chormaticity diagram are true? You can select more than one. 
True
(a)
At least some of the colors shown inside horsehoe shape incorrectly represent the color at those xyY coordinates, since they are generated from an image using the sRGB color space.
(b)
Monospectral lights (i.e. lights emitting a single frequency) would correspond to colors around the boundary of the horseshoe shape.
(c)
The set of colors that can be made by mixing together of three different frequencies of light would form a triangle in the diagram.

False:
(d)
The non-spectral purples along the bottom of the horsehoe can only be generated by mixing together more than 3 primary colors.


2. Color Perception
Which of the following facts is TRUE about human perception of color?

(c) It is possible that two lights that have completely different power spectral distributions will be perceived as the same color.

False:
(a) There are three kinds of cone cells in the human eye that each respond to a different single frequency of light.
(b) The HSV color space, because it uses a wheel of hues, can represent all the colors humans can perceive.
(d) Human color perception is most sensitive to light in the blue portion of the spectrum (i.e. light with a short wavelength).

3. How many colors
Suppose we use unsigned 8-bit integers to represent the value of each color channel in an RGB value, so the range is between 0 and 255.
1. How many unique colors can be represented?
Uniques Colors: 16777216 (2 power 24)

Colors represented by RGB can be percieved by human eye and that CIE XYZ space can have color combinations that cannot be percieved by human eye or repsented by RGB space.
You can represent more colors in RGB than humans can perceive but not all the colors humans can perceive.

4. RGB and CMY
The CMY color space (Cyan, Magenta and Yellow) is a subtractive color space designed for reflective displays such as printed material.
CMY is a complementary color space to RGB space. You can convert from an RGB representation of a color to a CMY representation using the matrix shown above. In this case, the colors are assumed to include an alpha channel as a fourth component.
How many colors have the same numeric representation both RGB and CMY? In other words, for how many colors is it true that the color (c1,c2,c3)RGB and the color (c1,c2,c3)CMY are the same color? 

Ans: 1

5. White Points
The illuminant D65 has XYZ coordinates of (0.9505, 1.0000, 1.0891) . Convert these to xyY and report the xy coordinates.

Ans: x = 0.31, y = 0.33 (x = x/x+y+z, y = y/x+y+z, z = z/x+y+z)

6. Gamma Correction
Consider the following RGB color x = (1, 0.3 ,1)
Supposes the color will be shown on a display with a gamma of 2.5 . If Xcorrected is gamma corrected version of X, enter the components of Xcorrected. 

Xcorrect = [1, 0.62, 1] 
v^(1/gamma)

7. sRGB to XYZ
Given an sRGB color CsRGB specified as a NumPy array, compute cXYZ. 
You should set up the conversion matrix M-1sRGB by simply hardcoding the numerical values for the entries as seen in class. 

import numpy as np
import numpy.linalg as la

minv = np.array([[0.412391, 0.357584, 0.180481],
        [0.212639, 0.715169, 0.072192],
        [0.019331, 0.119195, 0.950532]])
        
cxyz = minv.dot(csrgb)
